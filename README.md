Consolidation my learning from Kevin Powell's excellent (Conquering Responsive Layouts course|https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts)

Layout of the site
------------------

### Hero Text

This demonstrates the relation between a vertical section of a page, a container for the content in that section and then the content itself. In this context, these elements are used for the following purposes.

- Section
    - Covers the width of the visible page
        - An exception here would be with a side nav or a sidebar
    - Allows control of the background across that full width
    - Allows vertical spacing through padding
- Content Container
    - Position the content within the section
        - E.g., Limit the maximum width and centre horizontally
    - Control the arrangement of child content
        - E.g., Enable flexbox or flexgrid on the child items
